Ask the person on your left (or right) to pick a number. Now do the following:

 - double this number
 - add 9 to the result
 - subtract 3 from the result
 - divide the result by 2
 - subtract the original number from the result

**The answer should be 3.**
 
## Task
Write a program using the `challenge1.py` file on the left that does exactly what you have just done above. It should accept an integer (whole number) as input and then output the number 3 at the end by following the steps outlined.

**Running your program**
To run your program click on the `Run Challenge` button at the top. This will open a terminal. You can also use the terminal directly if you are familiar with it.

**Extension:** You could use a delay in your program and output a description of the mathematical operation that is taking place at the time. This will allow the user to see what is happening during the program stage-by-stage.

To do this, you will need to `import` Python's `time` module and use `time.sleep(n)` where `n` is the number of seconds delay that you would like. Ask your teacher for guidance here.
